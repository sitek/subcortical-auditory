# subcortical-auditory
We process self-generated sounds differently than externally generated sounds. There is ample evidence that much of this difference is due to auditory cortical processing.

But the auditory pathway doesn't start at the auditory cortex.  Subcortical structures contribute to auditory processing as sounds travel up the pathway.

But these structures can also send signals <i>down</i> the pathway. How do subcortical auditory structures contribute to speech motor control?

This project will use multiple brain imaging modalities to investigate how subcortical auditory processing and structure modulates how we process self-generated sounds such as speech.
